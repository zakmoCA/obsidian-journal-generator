## Installation Steps

1. Clone this repo
2. Navigate to project root in the terminal, and enter `chmod +x script.js`. This makes the file script.js executable.
3. Create a symlink. I created mine in `/usr/local/bin` on my macOS, with the following command:

`ln -s /absolute/path/to/obsidian-journal-generator/script.js /usr/local/bin/journal
`

Following the above, entering 'journal' in my command-line while inside any directory will execute the script, launching 
Obsidian and generating the relevant directories.

## Personalisation 

- [ ] Add Journal and Work Log templates I use
