## Installation Steps

1. Clone this repo
2. Navigate to project root in the terminal, and enter `chmod +x script.js`. This makes the file script.js executable.
3. Create a symlink. For example i created mine in `/usr/local/bin` on macOS, with the following command:

`ln -s /absolute/path/to/obsidian-journal-generator/script.js /usr/local/bin/journal
`

This allows me to enter 'journal' in my terminal while inside any directory, which will execute the script.
